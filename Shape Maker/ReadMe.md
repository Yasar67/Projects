# **Shape Maker**


## **Description:**

This is a Java program which creates 5 different shapes of variable size with two different path types. The length, height, border colour, fill colour and path types can be set. There is an information table which dynamically shows the x and y positions of each shape relative to the top of the display as well the length and height. Each shape created is also listed in a table where each folder is describes a parent shape and each file describes a child shape.
*__Note:__* The program is considered the overall parent shape.
